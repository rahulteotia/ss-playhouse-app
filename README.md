# Canvas Playground App
A demo app to play with shapes in 2D space on canvas.

The application is based on [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and uses [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).[Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html)is simply a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. Please [read](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-to-know-flux-the-react-js-architecture) to know more about flux architecture.

The setting up of environment is done using [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). 

[Webpack]((https://webpack.js.org/)) is a module bundler which takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets by bundling them together based on some configuration. 

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) allows us to use latest javascript syntax ES6. By using JSX and ES6 we can be more productive while working with React. But the JSX syntax and ES6, are not supported in all the browsers. Hence, if we are using them in the React code, we need to use a tool which translates them to the format that has been supported by the browsers. It's where babel comes into the picture.

**Instructions**

Please follow these steps to get up and running with the app.

1. Install [Git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node with NPM] (https://nodejs.org/en/). You may need to restart system for commands to be available on command prompt.

2. Checkout project using git command ```git clone https://github.com/rahulteotia/ss-playhouse-app```

3. Go to root folder of the project and run command ```npm install```

4. Once the above step is complete, please run ```npm start``` from the same location.

You can now access the app from location [http://localhost:5556/](http://localhost:5556/)
